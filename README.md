## Usage

- Enable developer console in the game settings

- Bind the console hotkey to F5 by running the command below in the console

    ```
    bind F5 "toggleconsole"
    ```

- Do not have csgo installed on an HDD due to long loading times

- Download and extract the latest release from the [releases tab](https://github.com/amitxv/csgo-autobenchmark/releases)

- Move ``video.txt`` to ``.\Steam\Userdata\*\730\local\cfg\``

- Move the ``csgo`` folder in [csgo-autobenchmark](https://github.com/samisalreadytaken/csgo-benchmark) to ``.\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive``

- Launch csgo to the lobby with the console closed

- Run csgo-autobenchmark through the command-line and press enter when ready to start benchmarking. There is a 7-second timeout to allow you to tab back into the game to give csgo foreground priority

- Do not touch your PC at all after this stage until the estimated time is up
