# csgo-autobenchmark

Automatic csgo benchmarking to mitigate systematic error using scripts from [csgo-benchmark](https://github.com/samisalreadytaken/csgo-benchmark).

## Usage

- Enable developer console in the game settings

- Bind the console hotkey to F5 by running the command below in the console

    ```txt
    bind F5 "toggleconsole"
    ```

- Do not have csgo installed on a HDD due to long loading times

- Download and extract the latest release from the [releases tab](https://github.com/amitxv/csgo-autobenchmark/releases)

- From the **prerequisites** folder

    - Move the **csgo** folder to ``.\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive``
    - Move **video.txt** to ``.\Steam\Userdata\*\730\local\cfg``

- Launch csgo to the lobby with the console closed

- Run **start.bat** and press enter when ready. There is a 7 second timeout to allow you to tab back into the game to give csgo foreground priority

- Do not touch your PC at all after after this stage until the estimated time is up
